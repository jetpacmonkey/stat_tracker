# Stat tracker!

Too many times, I have been listening to a podcast, or having an argument with a friend, and we've each ended up with a list of players. Wouldn't it be great to enter those lists somewhere, and then be reminded a year or two later who the winner of the argument was? That's the idea of what this tool will do. It doesn't do any such thing yet, but that's the idea.
